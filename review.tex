\section{Gaffmonk}

\begin{itemize}
\item Schnakenberg (LI) model considered
\item Sensitivity of final pattern to ICs
\item Times to onset of patterning increases drastically as delay is increased.
\item Delay on O(minutes) leads to increase in TTP on O(hours)
\item (Example of embryonic development)
\item Time delays cannot be neglected in general, when considering patterning events which occur on a fast timescale.
\item No oscillations found (only delay in activator term)
\end{itemize}

\section{LeeGaffney}

\begin{itemize}
\item GM model (LI, RLB) models considered
\item Linear theory does not predict presence of oscillations. Linear theory unreliabel in presence of time delays
\item Patterning fails to exist for large enough time delay (LI)
\item Small lags cause unreasonably large time to pattern (LI)
\item Oscillations occur with time delay (RLB)
\item Results more likely to be generic, as different models considered.
\item Model selection where delay is present must be carefully considered.
\item Turing models do reproduce biological phenomena that can be otherwise difficult to explain, yet the results are sensitive to gene expression dynamics.
\item Exploration of a stabilising mechanism ?
\end{itemize}

\section{Jiang}

\begin{itemize}
\item Schnakenberg RLB model considered
\item Linear analysis, dynamical systems theory
\item Time delay can cause inhomogeneous periodic solutions (oscillations)
\item Can cause de-stabilisation of spatially inhomogeneous steady states.
\end{itemize}

\section{LeeGaffneyMonk}
\begin{itemize}
  \item GM model (LI, RLB)
  \item `Linear theory also significantly underestimates the timescales of the patterning lag in the presense of LI'
  \item Introduction of delay increases on sensitivity of final patterns
  \item Temporal oscillations observed in RLB
  \item Temporal oscillations do not occur, but time to patterning sensitive to delay
\end{itemize}

\section{YiGaffLi}

\begin{itemize}
\item Schnakenberg (LI, RLB)
\item Time delay (LI) antogonises pattern formation
\item RLB model can cause oscillations and
