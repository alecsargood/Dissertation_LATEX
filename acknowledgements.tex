\section*{\centering{Acknowledgements}}


I would like to thank my supervisors Dr. Andrew Krause and Professor Eamonn Gaffney for all of their advice and guidance throughout my dissertation. I would like to especially thank Andrew for his continued and tireless effort to support me, not only throughout the dissertation process, but also throughout the MMSC. From meeting Andrew at my MMSC interview and having him as a departmental supervisor in Michaelmas term, to being able to work on modelling case studies and the dissertation under his supervision in Hilary and Trinity terms, I am extremely grateful for all of his hard work and mentorship that has undoubtedly shaped my academic experience at Oxford.\\\\
Completing and coping with the arduous demands of the MMSC course, whilst juggling a global pandemic, would not have been possible had it not been for my fellow MMSC cohort. This has been my most academically challenging year, yet also been made one of my most enjoyable by the fantastic people around me. In this vein, I would also like to thank Dr. Kathryn Gillow for her attentiveness and advice, both academically and pastorally, throughout the year.\\\\
I would most like to thank my family for their unconditional support and belief in me. I am certain that I would not be where I am today without them.\\\\
Finally, I want to dedicate part of this work to one of my closest friends, Rodion Matveev, who tragically lost his life on the 14th of August 2021.
