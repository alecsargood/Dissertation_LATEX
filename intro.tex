\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

The self-organisation of cells into an apparent order appears across many different fields within biology. For example, the distribution of cells during the developmental process of an embryo, the growth of cancerous tissue \cite{morph}, vertebrate limb development \cite{miura1,glimm,miura2}, and pattern formation on animal coats (e.g spots on a jaguar \cite{painter}, feathers on birds \cite{bailleul}). Wolpert \cite{wolpert} presented the idea that, underpinning the development of shape and form (morphogenesis) is a cell's ability to differentiate according to its position in space and time. Furthermore, the concentration of certain chemicals (morphogens), or the concentration gradients of certain morphogens across a spatial domain of cells, affects the cell differentiation mechanism, and thus cells adopt a state relative to the concentration of a specific morphogen that they are exposed to.

The mechanism allowing cells to adopt an appropriate state is known as differential gene expression, and depends crucially on the communication between cells, achieved through cellular signalling \cite{gaffmonk}. Typical reaction-diffusion systems assume a negligible timescale on which the cellular signalling and gene expression processes occur. The gene expression process is however extremely complex and proceeds through several stages \cite{gaffmonk}, namely gene transcription and gene translation. These sub-processes can take large amounts of time, and it has been experimentally shown that these time delays are typically on the order of minutes, but in some cases can be as large as a few hours \cite{gaffmonk,tennyson}. These time delays can therefore be on the same order of magnitude as the pattern formation process itself. For example, the basic body plan of a zebrafish is established in less than 24 hours \cite{gaffmonk,kimmel}. It is therefore important to consider these delays when studying pattern formation in Turing mechanisms.

In 1952 \cite{turing}, Alan Turing proposed that the morphogenesis process could be mathematically modelled on a purely chemical basis via the interaction of morphogens, whose evolutions are described by a system of coupled reaction-diffusion equations. Turing showed that a stable steady state, robust to small perturbations in the spatially homogeneous setting, could become unstable and sensitive to small perturbations with the introduction of diffusion, leading to spatially inhomogeneous patterns. The idea is that, morphogens can spontaneously form patterns via a Turing mechanism. Cell fate decisions are then based on these morphogen concentrations, where regions of high morphogen or low morphogen concentration can lead to different cell fate decisions. Turing's model is theory is therefore one of pre-patterning, where the morphogen pattern concentrations across a spatial domain are modelled, which in turn lead to cell fate decisions at a later stage. Typical reaction-diffusion systems in the context of Turing pattern formation consist of two partial differential equations, desribing the interaction and evolution of two morphogens, the \textit{activator} and \textit{inhibitor}.

Time ddelays have been investigated in the context of Turing patterns, both numerically and analytically, through the incorporation of constant fixed time delays. One of the canonical reaction-diffusion mechanismcs that exhibits Turing instabilities is the Schnakenberg model \cite{schnakenberg}. This model has been extensively studied in the context of Turing pattern formation with incorporated gene expression time delays. Two biologically motivated variants, ligand-internalisation (LI) and reverse ligand-binding (RLB), have been considered in the literature. The Schnakenberg reaction kinetics can be described as \textit{cross} kinetics \cite{leegaffney}, where the inhibitor upregulates the activator, which in turn downregulates the activator. The LI model places gene expression time delay in purely the activator's dynamics, whereas the RLB model contains time delay in both the activator's and inhibitor's dynamics.

The numerical results in \cite{gaffmonk}, which studied the LI variant of the Schnakenberg model \cite{schnakenberg}, showed that time taken until pattern formation occurs drastically increases as the gene expression time delay in the model is increased, and that small delays, on the order of minutes, can cause a large increase in time-to-pattern, on the order of several hours, compared to a model with no time delay. This highlights the importance of studying gene expression time delays, especially when considering patterning events that occur on a fast timescale. The two dissertations \cite{jiang, yigaffneyli} consider both the LI and RLB variants of the Schnakenberg model. Using linear analysis and dynamical systems theory, the results in \cite{jiang} suggest that, with an incorporated time delay, the RLB model can exhibit spatially inhomogeneous temporal oscillations, as well as de-stabilisation of spatially inhomogeneous steady states, inhibiting patterm formation via Turing instabilities.

Another typical reaction-diffusion system studied with gene expression time delays extensively in literature is the Gierer-Meinhard (GM) model \cite{gm}. General results in both \cite{leegaffney,leegaffmonk} suggest that time delay causes a significant effect on the time taken until pattern formation occurs. Both papers also suggest that linear theory is insufficient in determining the presence of oscillations, and \cite{leegaffmonk} suggests that the severity of the effect that time delays will have on the timescales on which patterning events will occur cannot be accurately predicted from linear theory. A final observation from \cite{gaffmonk,leegaffmonk} is that an increasing time delay may also increase the sensitivity of the final pattern formation to variation in initial conditions. More recently however, analysis of spike solutions of the GM model in \cite{fadai1,fadai2}, show that the biological interpretation, and thus the placement of delay terms in the model, can affect the size of the parameter regimes for which the spike solution is linearly stable. It was found that when a fixed time delay was considered solely in the activator dynamics, the delay acted as a stabilising agent, enlarging the stable parameter region of the spike \cite{fadai2}, i.e increasing the range of parameters for which the spike solutions existed and were stable. We aim to show a similar result for the LI variant, where delay terms are also only placed in the activator's dynamics. This is in stark contrast to the de-stabilising effect that an increase in time delay was found to have when delay terms were placed in both the activator and inhibitor dynamics \cite{fadai1}.

Paradoxically, we see that although Turing's models can be used to explain and reproduce complex biological phenomena \cite{leegaffney}, the model results seem to be dependent one gene expression dynamics, and as most of the current literature shows, gene expression time delays can provide difficulty in applying Turing's models to real systems. In summary, most of the literature shows that gene expression time delays reduce the size of the parameter regimes with pattern-forming Turing instabilities, and increase the time to pattern. This latter effect in particular is an obstacle to using Turing mechanisms due to the timescales involved. Time delays can induce much larger delays in pattern onset, compared to the otherwise fast pattern onset that would occur without time delay, calling into question how relevant and applicable Turing's models are for patterning events on fast timescales.

We note that the current literature is only concerned with Turing pattern formation in the context of fixed time delays. On a cellular level however, the biological processes responsible for gene expression are inherently stochastic \cite{raj,elowitz,mcadams,paulsson}. Introducing a fixed time delay into the kinetic equations is an oversimplification of the underlying biological process on a microscopic level, and leads us to consider a distribution of time delays at the macroscopic level \cite{bratsun,krausenew}. In this dissertation we are interested in conducting a more systematic study of the time to pattern properties of models with fixed time delay, and a more careful consideration of sensitivity to intial and boundary conditions. We are also concerned with whether implementing a different form of delay, specifically distributed delay, can alleviate some of the problems caused by the fixed delay case.

In this rest of this Chapter, we will first outline some of the mathematical preliminaries used throughout this dissertation, including an outline of Turing pattern theory, and the numerical methods we use. In Chapter 2, we study the LI variant of the Schnakenberg model, where time-delayed terms are considered only in the activator's dynamics. We use numerical simulations to systematically evaluate the robustness of results in current literature to variations in initial and boundary conditions, and show that, although the type of pattern we see may be affected by these variations, the relationship between time delay and time-to-pattern is robust. We also extend the current linear theory presented in literature and study the effect of fixed time delays on the Turing space (the parameter regions such that Turing instabilities can occur), as well as formalising a linear relationship between time delay, and time-to-pattern. Finally, Chapter 3 will focus on the distributed delay model. We aim to produce novel linear analysis for the distributed delay case, and numerically verify any observations we make.

\section{Model Introduction}
\subsection{Without Time Delay}
The mathematical model we will consider is the Schnakenberg model \cite{schnakenberg} - one of the simplest `toy' models that exhibit some of the key behaviours that we are interested in, and has also been studied extensively in the context of fixed time delays. The model describes the evolution and interaction between two reactants, $U$ and $V$. Only considering two reactants is a gross simplification of the underlying biological processes responsible for pattern formation, but it is still a non-trivial case than can admit Turing instabilities. In this dissertation, we restrict our investigation to one spatial domain. The chemical reaction describing the Schnakenberg kinetics is given by \cite{baker}
\begin{equation}\label{chem}
A\xrightleftharpoons[c_{-1}]{c_1} U,\quad B\xrightarrow{c_2} V,\quad 2U+V\xrightarrow{c_3} 3U
\end{equation}
The quantities $A$ and $B$ are substances whose evolution is not considered, and we assume a constant supply. We use $u$, $v$, $a$, and $b$ to denote the concentrations of substances $U$, $V$, $A$ and $B$ respectively. Letting the reactants diffuse, and applying the law of mass action with a non-dimensionalisation yields the reaction-diffusion system
\begin{equation}\label{system}
    \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&=\frac{\epsilon^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+a-u+u^2v,\\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}&=\frac{1}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+b-u^2v,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $x\in\Omega=[0,1]$ is the non-dimesionalised spatial domain $a,b>0$ are fixed parameters. The parameter $\epsilon^2$ can be thought of as the ratio of diffusion coefficients between the activator $u$ and inhibitor $v$, and $L^2$ a scaling of the domain length on which the problem is being solved. Typical values in the literature (\cite{gaffmonk}) are $L^2=1/200$ and $\epsilon^2=0.001$. Unless otherwise stated, we use the same $\epsilon^2=0.001$, and a domain size, $L$, $30$ times of that used in \cite{gaffmonk}, namely $L^2=9/2$. Since we are interested in the pattern formation arising from the self-organisation of cells, we implement no flux (homogeneous Neumann) boundary conditions on the boundary of the spatial domain $\partial\Omega$, namely $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0$ at $x=0, 1$. As typical when studying Turing patterns, initial conditions will be chosen as a small random perturbation from the spatially homogeneous steady state.

\subsection{With Fixed Time Delay}

The form of the model we consider with fixed time delay is the ligand-internalisation (LI) variant of the standard Schnakenberg model. The LI model assumes that a reaction at the cell surface is followed by internalisation of a morphogen before the gene expression process can continue and morphogen production can occur \cite{leegaffney,yigaffneyli}. The time-delayed terms in the LI model only appear in the activator's dynamics. This is based on the assumption that the gene expression process, and thus the source of the time delay, is responsible for autocatalysis of the activator in the reaction-diffusion mechanism \cite{gaffmonk}. Applying the delay to the kinetics in the cubic nonlinearity term \cite{baker} in \eqref{chem} yields the reaction described by
\begin{equation}\label{chem2}
A\xrightleftharpoons[c_{-1}]{c_1} U,\quad B\xrightarrow{c_2} V,\quad 2U+V\xrightarrow{c_3} W\quad W\xrightarrow{\text{\footnotesize delay } \tau}3U,
\end{equation}
The reaction describes an internalisation of two particles of $U$, and one particle of $V$, which are removed from the reaction, represented by substance $W$. However, three particles of $U$ are obtained from a reaction at a time $\tau$ in the past. The reaction-diffusion system describing the LI model is thus written as \cite{leegaffney}
\begin{equation}\label{fixed}
  \begin{split}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&=\frac{\epsilon^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+a-u-2u^2v+3\hat{u}^2\hat{v}\\
  \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}&=\frac{1}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial x^2}+b-u^2v,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $u=u(x,t)$, $v=v(x,t)$ and $\hat{u}$, $\hat{v}$ are evaluated at some delay $\tau$, so that $\hat{u}=u(x,t-\tau)$ and $\hat{v}=v(x,t-\tau)$.

\subsection{With Distributed Time Delay}

The stochastic nature of gene expression delays leads us to consider a mean-field approach to modelling the time delay \cite{bratsun,krausenew}. We can thus write the LI model with distributed time delay as

\begin{equation}\label{distmodel}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&=\frac{\epsilon^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+a-u-2u^2v+3\int_{a}^{b}k(s;\textbf{p})\hat{u}^2\hat{v} \ \text{ds},\\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}&=\frac{1}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial x^2}+b-u^2v,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{u}=u(x,t-s)$ and $\hat{v}=v(x,t-s)$, with $s$ the integration variable ranging over the delays. The function $k(s;\textbf{p})$ denotes a general probability distribution function, with $s$ the integration variable, and $\textbf{p}$ the distribution parameters. The integration domain of delays is given by $[a,b]$ with $a>0$ to ensure positve time delays.  Choices of different probability density functions will be considered in more detail in Chapter \ref{section:distdel}.

\section{Mathematical Preliminaries}
\subsection{Turing Pattern Formation Without Delay}
Here we give a brief overview of the mathematical theory underpinning Turing pattern formation, closely following the description in \cite{murray}. For further details, the reader should consult \cite{murray,beentjes}. Turing patterns occur when the spatially homogeneous stable steady state becomes unstable in the presence of diffusion. We therefore first consider the spatially homogeneous model, and explore conditions necessary for the steady state to be stable. In the case of the Schnakenberg model, the single steady state, $(u_\star, v_\star)$, occurs at $(u_\star, v_\star)=\left(a+b, \frac{b}{(a+b)^2}\right)$. Since $a,b>0$, we have $u_\star,v_\star>0$. Following the methodology in \cite{murray}, we perform linear stability analysis. Taking a small perturbation from the steady state, so that $u=u_\star+\delta\xi $, $v=v_\star+\delta\eta $ for $|\delta|<<1$, we consider the evolution of the perturbation. Denoting $\pmb{\xi}=\begin{bmatrix}\xi \\ \eta\end{bmatrix}$ as the vector of perturbations, the linearised system of \eqref{system} is given as

\begin{equation}\label{linsys}
\frac{d\pmb{\xi}}{dt}=\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)}\pmb{\xi},
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the kinetic equations evaluated at the steady state. Namely,
$$
\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)}=\begin{pmatrix}f_u&f_v\\g_u&g_v\end{pmatrix}\Bigg|_{(u_\star,v_\star)}.
$$
The notation $f_u$ is used to denote the partial derivatve of $f$ with respect to $u$. Solutions of \eqref{linsys} are of the form
$$
\pmb{\xi}\propto e^{\lambda t},
$$
for eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $J_{(u_\star,v_\star)}$. The steady state is asymptotically stable if the perturbation decays.
Denoting $\text{spec}(\textbf{M})$ as the set of eigenvalues of some matrix $\textbf{M}$, asymptotic stability occurs when $\Re(\lambda)<0 \ \text{for all }\lambda\in \text{spec}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})$. However, if there exists $\lambda\in \text{spec}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})\text{ such that } \Re(\lambda)>0$,
then the pertubation will grow with time and the steady state in unstable. The sum and product of the eigenvalues of $\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)}$
are given by $\text{Tr}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})$ and $\text{det}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})$ respectively. The required conditions for stability are therefore
\begin{equation}\label{cond1}
    \begin{split}
\text{Tr}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})<0 &\implies (f_u+g_v)\big|_{(u_\star,v_\star)}<0, \\
\text{det}(\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)})>0 &\implies (f_ug_v-f_vg_u)\big|_{(u_\star,v_\star)}>0,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We now consider the full diffusive model and look for necessary conditions such that the previously stable steady state is driven to instability. The linearised system is given by
\begin{equation}\label{linsys2}
    \frac{\partial \pmb{\xi}}{\partial t}=\left[\textbf{D}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}+\textbf{J}_{(u_\star,v_\star)} \right]\pmb{\xi},
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{D}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\epsilon^2}{L^2}&0\\0&\frac{1}{L^2}\end{pmatrix}$ is the matrix containing the diffusion coefficients of reactants. The solution to the spatially dependent eigenvalue problem can be written as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions $w_k$ that satisfy the problem
\begin{equation}\label{eigprob}
\nabla^2w_k=-k^2w_k,\quad \quad \frac{\partial w_k}{\partial x}=0\text{ for } x=0, 1.
\end{equation}
Considering only a regular 1D domain $\Omega=[0,1]$ with no flux boundary conditions, the eigenfunctions will be of the form $w_k=\cos(k\pi x)$, $x\in[0,1]$. We thus look for solutions to \eqref{linsys2} of the form
\begin{equation}\label{perturbgrow}
    \pmb{\xi}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \textbf{c}_ke^{\lambda_k t}w_k(x),
\end{equation}
where the constants $\textbf{c}_k$ are determined by using a Fourier expansion of the initial conditions in terms of the eigenfunctions $w_k$. $\lambda_k$ is the eigenvalue which determines the rate of temporal growth for each mode $k$, and thus determines whether a particular mode of pattern will be unstable and grow. Substituting this form \eqref{perturbgrow} into \eqref{linsys2}, along with using \eqref{eigprob} and simplifying, we obtain, for each $k$
$$
\lambda_k w_k=\textbf{J}w_k-\textbf{D}k^2w_k \implies (\lambda_k \textbf{I}-\textbf{J}+k^2\textbf{D})w_k=\textbf{0},
$$
with $\textbf{I}$ the identity matrix. Looking for non-trivial solutions for $w_k$, we solve for roots of the characteristic polynomial, namely $\text{det}(\lambda_k \textbf{I}-\textbf{J}+k^2\textbf{D})=0$, which yields a quadratic equation for eigenvalues $\lambda_k(k)$ as a function of $k$. Finding roots of this quadratic such that $\Re(\lambda_k(k))>0$ for some $k\neq0$, we can conclude two necessary conditions for the instability of the steady state in the presence of diffusion, namely
\begin{equation}\label{cond2}
    \begin{split}
    \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}f_u+g_v\right)\bigg|_{(u_\star,v_\star)}>0&\\
    \left(\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}f_u+g_v\right)^2-\frac{4}{\epsilon^2}(f_ug_v-f_vg_u)\right)\bigg|_{(u_\star,v_\star)}>0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We therefore have four necessary conditions in terms of $(a,b,\epsilon^2)$ for Turing patterns to occur. These conditions are only necessary, and not sufficient, as conditions \eqref{cond2} assume $k$ to be a continuous variable, rather than discrete, and this is only strictly valid in the limit $L\to\infty$. Using the first two conditions in \eqref{cond1}, a bifurcation diagram in the $(a,b)$ parameter space can be plotted showing the regions corresponding to a stable or unstable steady state. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:bifsh}. Using the additional conditions in \eqref{cond2} and the fixed value $\epsilon^2=0.001$, the parameter region in the $(a,b)$ parameter space in which Turing patterns can occur can also be plotted. This `Turing space' can be seen in figure \ref{fig:turingspace}.

\subsection{Numerical Implementation}\label{section:numimp}
In order to numerically resolve the spatial derivatives $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$, $\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}$ and implement the relevant boundary conditions, a finite-difference scheme is used. Throughout the dissertation we use $m=500$ equally spaced spatial discretisation points on the domain $x\in\Omega=[0,1]$. This discretisation results in $m=500$ delay differential equations (DDEs) in time, which are solved numerically. Further details on the derivation and implementation of the finite difference scheme and boundary conditions can be found in appendix \ref{section:appA}.

Reaction-diffusion systems can be numerically stiff to solve \cite{stiff1, william}, and thus to solve these systems with time delay, we require stiff numerical solvers suitable for DDEs. The inherent stiffness of the problem makes standard DDE solvers in MATLAB such as \emph{dde23} and \emph{ddesd} unsuitable, and past work has been restricted in the progress made through numerical simulations \cite{william} due to the computationally expensive task of solving reaction-diffusion systems with non-stiff solvers. Standard stiff solvers in MATLAB, such as \emph{ode23s} and \emph{ode15s} do not support time delay. We therefore use the Julia language to numerically solve these systems. Julia has an extensive differential equations solver suite \cite{rodas}, and has the capability to apply the method of steps \cite{methsteps} to a stiff solver, allowing the incorporation of fixed time delays. Throughout the dissertation we use absolute and relative solver tolerances of $10^{-6}$, with a maximum timestep set as $0.1$. For these tolerances, the default stiff solver implemented by Julia is \emph{Rodas5}, a 5-th order A-stable solver, from the family of Rosenbrock methods \cite{rodas}. An interested reader can find more details on Rosenbrock methods in \cite{rosenbrock}.
